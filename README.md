Certainly! Here's a list of 200 interview questions and answers for ASP.NET Core Web API with Clean Architecture, along with sample code examples:

# 1. What is ASP.NET Core?
  ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source web development framework built by Microsoft. It allows developers to build web applications and APIs using the .NET programming language. 

ASP.NET Core is designed to be fast, modular, and scalable. It provides a unified framework for building web applications that can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. 

Some key features of ASP.NET Core include:
- Cross-platform compatibility: ASP.NET Core applications can be developed and deployed on multiple operating systems, giving developers flexibility in choosing their preferred platform.
- High performance: ASP.NET Core is optimized for performance, providing fast response times and efficient resource usage.
- Modularity: It allows developers to choose and include only the required components for their application, keeping the application lightweight and reducing unnecessary overhead.
- Dependency Injection: ASP.NET Core has built-in support for dependency injection, which helps manage object dependencies and promotes loose coupling, making it easier to maintain and test applications.

# 2. What is Clean Architecture?
  Clean Architecture is a software architecture pattern that helps in building maintainable and scalable applications by promoting the      separation of concerns and clear boundaries between different layers of the application.

  In Clean Architecture, the application is divided into different layers, each with a specific responsibility:

  Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and presenting information to the users. It includes components like UI, web API controllers, views, or any other user interface elements.

  Application Layer: The application layer contains the business logic and orchestrates the flow of data and operations. It acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the domain layer, handling requests from the presentation layer, and invoking the appropriate operations in the domain layer.

  Domain Layer: This layer represents the core of the application and contains the business rules, entities, and logic. It encapsulates the fundamental concepts and behaviors of the application, independent of any specific technology or framework. The domain layer should be independent and not rely on any external dependencies.

  Infrastructure Layer: The infrastructure layer provides implementations for external concerns such as databases, file systems, external services, or any other external dependencies. It includes components like data access, third-party integrations, and infrastructure-specific configurations.

  The key principles of Clean Architecture are:

  Dependency Rule: The dependencies should always point inward. In other words, the inner layers (domain and application) should not depend on the outer layers (presentation and infrastructure). This promotes loose coupling and makes the inner layers independent and easier to test.

  Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a specific responsibility and should focus on its own concerns. This separation improves maintainability and allows for easier changes and updates to specific parts of the system without affecting others.

  Testability: Clean Architecture promotes testability by allowing easy unit testing of the core business logic in the domain layer. The separation of concerns and dependency inversion make it simpler to write isolated tests for each layer.

# 3. How do you create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project?
   You can create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project using the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   dotnet new webapi -n MyWebApi
   ```

# 4. What is a controller in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   In ASP.NET Core Web API, a controller is a class that handles HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. It contains action methods that are invoked based on the incoming request's HTTP method and route.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   public class UserController : ControllerBase
   {
       [HttpGet]
       public IActionResult Get()
       {
           // Retrieve and return data
       }
   }
   ```

# 5. How do you handle route parameters in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   Route parameters can be specified in the route template of a controller or action method. They are enclosed in curly braces `{}` and can be accessed as parameters in the corresponding action method.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpGet("{id}")]
   public IActionResult GetById(int id)
   {
       // Retrieve data by ID
   }
   ```

# 6. What is model binding in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   Model binding is the process of mapping data from HTTP requests to parameters or model objects in controller action methods. It automatically converts incoming request data (e.g., query string, route parameters, request body) into the corresponding types.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create(UserDto user)
   {
       // Create a new user based on the received data
   }
   ```

# 7. How do you handle validation in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   ASP.NET Core provides built-in validation features through data annotations and model validation. You can annotate model properties with validation attributes, and the framework automatically performs validation during model binding.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   public class UserDto
   {
       [Required]
       public string Name { get; set; }

       [EmailAddress]
       public string Email { get; set; }
   }
   ```

# 8. How do you return different types of HTTP responses from a Web API controller?
   You can return different types of HTTP responses, such as `OkResult`, `BadRequestResult`, `NotFoundResult`, `CreatedAtActionResult`, etc., based on the specific scenario. These result types inherit from the `ActionResult` class.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create(UserDto user)
   {
       if (!ModelState.IsValid)
       {
           return BadRequest(ModelState);
       }

       // Create a new user and return CreatedAtActionResult
   }
   ```

# 9. How do you implement authentication in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   ASP.NET Core provides various authentication options, such as JWT, cookies, and external providers. You can configure authentication middleware and apply authentication attributes to secure specific endpoints or controllers.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [Authorize]
   [HttpGet]
   public IActionResult Get()
   {


       // Only authenticated users can access this endpoint
   }
   ```

# 10. How do you handle errors and exceptions in ASP.NET Core Web API?
    ASP.NET Core provides middleware and features to handle errors and exceptions. You can use middleware like `UseExceptionHandler` or `UseStatusCodePages` to customize error handling behavior. Additionally, you can create custom exception filters to handle specific exceptions.

    Sample code:
    ```csharp
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }

        // Other middleware configurations
    }
    ```
