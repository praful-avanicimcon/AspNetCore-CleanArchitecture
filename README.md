Certainly! Here's a list of 200 interview questions and answers for ASP.NET Core Web API with Clean Architecture, along with sample code examples:

# 1. What is ASP.NET Core?
  ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source web development framework built by Microsoft. It allows developers to build web applications and APIs using the .NET programming language. 

ASP.NET Core is designed to be fast, modular, and scalable. It provides a unified framework for building web applications that can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. 

Some key features of ASP.NET Core include:
- Cross-platform compatibility: ASP.NET Core applications can be developed and deployed on multiple operating systems, giving developers flexibility in choosing their preferred platform.
- High performance: ASP.NET Core is optimized for performance, providing fast response times and efficient resource usage.
- Modularity: It allows developers to choose and include only the required components for their application, keeping the application lightweight and reducing unnecessary overhead.
- Dependency Injection: ASP.NET Core has built-in support for dependency injection, which helps manage object dependencies and promotes loose coupling, making it easier to maintain and test applications.

# 2. What is Clean Architecture?
  Clean Architecture is a software architecture pattern that helps in building maintainable and scalable applications by promoting the separation of concerns and clear boundaries between different layers of the application.

Here's a simplified explanation of the layers in Clean Architecture:

1. Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying information to users. It includes components like user interfaces, web API controllers, or views. The focus is on capturing user input and presenting data to the user.

2. Application Layer: The application layer acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the domain layer. It contains the application-specific logic, such as processing user requests, coordinating operations, and executing business workflows. This layer is responsible for application flow and interacts with both the presentation and domain layers.

3. Domain Layer: The domain layer represents the core of the application. It contains the business rules, entities, and logic that define the problem domain. This layer is technology-agnostic and should not depend on external frameworks or infrastructure. It encapsulates the fundamental concepts and behaviors of the application.

4. Infrastructure Layer: The infrastructure layer handles external concerns and provides implementations for data access, third-party integrations, or any external dependencies. It includes components like databases, file systems, external services, and frameworks. The infrastructure layer interacts with the domain layer and provides the necessary infrastructure for the application to function.

The key principles of Clean Architecture are:

- Dependency Rule: The dependencies between layers should be organized in such a way that the inner layers do not depend on the outer layers. This helps in achieving loose coupling and ensures that changes in one layer do not affect other layers. For example, the domain layer does not depend on the infrastructure layer.

- Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a specific responsibility and focuses on its own concerns. This separation makes the codebase more organized and maintainable. Changes can be made to one layer without affecting the others.

- Testability: Clean Architecture promotes testability by enabling easy unit testing of individual layers. Since each layer is decoupled, it can be tested in isolation, making it simpler to write unit tests. This ensures that each layer functions correctly and independently.

# 3. How do you create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project?
   You can create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project using the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   dotnet new webapi -n MyWebApi
   ```

# 4. What is a controller in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   In ASP.NET Core Web API, a controller is a class that handles HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. It contains action methods that are invoked based on the incoming request's HTTP method and route.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   public class UserController : ControllerBase
   {
       [HttpGet]
       public IActionResult Get()
       {
           // Retrieve and return data
       }
   }
   ```

# 5. How do you handle route parameters in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   Route parameters can be specified in the route template of a controller or action method. They are enclosed in curly braces `{}` and can be accessed as parameters in the corresponding action method.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpGet("{id}")]
   public IActionResult GetById(int id)
   {
       // Retrieve data by ID
   }
   ```

# 6. What is model binding in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   Model binding is the process of mapping data from HTTP requests to parameters or model objects in controller action methods. It automatically converts incoming request data (e.g., query string, route parameters, request body) into the corresponding types.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create(UserDto user)
   {
       // Create a new user based on the received data
   }
   ```

# 7. How do you handle validation in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   ASP.NET Core provides built-in validation features through data annotations and model validation. You can annotate model properties with validation attributes, and the framework automatically performs validation during model binding.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   public class UserDto
   {
       [Required]
       public string Name { get; set; }

       [EmailAddress]
       public string Email { get; set; }
   }
   ```

# 8. How do you return different types of HTTP responses from a Web API controller?
   You can return different types of HTTP responses, such as `OkResult`, `BadRequestResult`, `NotFoundResult`, `CreatedAtActionResult`, etc., based on the specific scenario. These result types inherit from the `ActionResult` class.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create(UserDto user)
   {
       if (!ModelState.IsValid)
       {
           return BadRequest(ModelState);
       }

       // Create a new user and return CreatedAtActionResult
   }
   ```

# 9. How do you implement authentication in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   ASP.NET Core provides various authentication options, such as JWT, cookies, and external providers. You can configure authentication middleware and apply authentication attributes to secure specific endpoints or controllers.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [Authorize]
   [HttpGet]
   public IActionResult Get()
   {


       // Only authenticated users can access this endpoint
   }
   ```

# 10. How do you handle errors and exceptions in ASP.NET Core Web API?
    ASP.NET Core provides middleware and features to handle errors and exceptions. You can use middleware like `UseExceptionHandler`
    or `UseStatusCodePages` to customize error handling behavior. Additionally, you can create custom exception filters to handle 
    specific exceptions.

    Sample code:
    ```csharp
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }

        // Other middleware configurations
    }
    ```

       }
   }
   ```

# 15. How do you configure routing in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   Routing in ASP.NET Core Web API can be configured in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class. You can define routes using attributes on the controller and action methods or use conventional routing.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
   {
       app.UseRouting();

       app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
       {
           endpoints.MapControllers();
       });
   }
   ```

# 16. What is the role of Models in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   Models in ASP.NET Core Web API represent the data structures used for input and output in the API. They define the shape of the data being sent or received in the requests and responses.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   public class User
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public string Email { get; set; }
   }
   ```

# 17. How do you handle HTTP GET requests with parameters in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   You can handle HTTP GET requests with parameters in ASP.NET Core Web API by defining route templates and binding the parameters from the route, query string, or request body.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpGet("{id}")]
   public IActionResult GetById(int id)
   {
       // Code to retrieve a user by ID
       return Ok(user);
   }
   ```

8. How do you return different types of HTTP responses in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   In ASP.NET Core Web API, you can return different types of HTTP responses using the `IActionResult` interface. It provides various methods to return common HTTP status codes and custom responses.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpGet]
   public IActionResult Get()
   {
       if (users.Any())
       {
           return Ok(users);
       }
       else
       {
           return NoContent();
       }
   }
   ```

# 19. How do you handle HTTP POST requests with JSON data in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   You can handle HTTP POST requests with JSON data in ASP

.NET Core Web API by using the `[FromBody]` attribute to bind the JSON data to a parameter in the action method.

   Sample code:
   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create([FromBody] User user)
   {
       // Code to create a new user
       return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), new { id = user.Id }, user);
   }
   ```

# 20. How do you implement dependency injection in ASP.NET Core Web API?
    Dependency injection in ASP.NET Core Web API can be implemented by registering dependencies in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class. You can use the built-in container or a third-party container.
